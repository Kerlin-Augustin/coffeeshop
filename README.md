## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, MongoDB

My learning was focused on allowing customers to make an order. Then registering who completed the order for that customer using update request.

## Lessons Learned:

Working through this program I couldn't figure out why the log in feature was buggy. I went to google and discovered middlewares and how to apply them. This allowed me to create a site that can authenticate when a worker logs into the account.
